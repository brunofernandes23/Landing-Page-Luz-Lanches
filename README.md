Hi, this is Bruno Fernandes! 

In this project I recreated a project from Danki Code's Front End Course.

I used the methods mentioned in the course and implemented a fictitious company of my own.

When I did this project I was still learning the basics, but I thought it was amazing and I really enjoyed doing it!

Hope you like it!

Code is Life! xD
